LAMMPS tips
===========

Choose where to compile LAMMPS
------------------------------

If the code must be accessed only by you, you can save it in your ``/home/`` folder on
Dahu/Bigfoot. If you want the code to be available to all the member from
your group, you can use ``/bettik/PROJECTS/``. For instance, for the members of `tamtam`:

.. code-block:: bash

    /bettik/PROJECTS/pr-tamtam/

Download LAMMPS 
---------------

From the |LAMMPS| webpage, download the version of your choice.
For instance, from the terminal, download the last stable release:

.. code-block:: bash

    wget https://download.lammps.org/tars/lammps.tar.gz
    tar -xzvf lammps.tar.gz

.. |LAMMPS| raw:: html

    <a href="https://www.lammps.org/download.html" target="_blank">LAMMPS</a>


Compile LAMMPS with make
--------------

For compiling in serial, simply navidate to the ``src/`` folder, and type:

.. code-block:: bash

    make serial

For compilling in parallel, you will need to load manually openmpi and gcc using NIX:

.. code-block:: bash

    source /applis/site/nix.sh
    nix-shell -p openmpi -p gcc

Then, from the ``src/`` folder, type:

.. code-block:: bash

    make mpi

Compile LAMMPS with cmake using guix environment
--------------

source your guix environment and install the following package(specified the openmpi version, some issues were observed on dahu cluster with openmpi 5)

.. code-block::

    source /applis/site/guix-start.sh
    guix install cmake
    guix install glibc-locales
    guix install gcc-toolchain
    guix install openmpi@4.1.6
    guix install clang
    guix install ffmpeg

navigate into your lammps home, create a folder ``build/``. From the ``build/`` folder, compile LAMMPS:

.. code-block::

    mkdir build
    cd build 
    cmake ../cmake -D PKG_MOLECULE=on -D PKG_KSPACE=on -D PKG_RIGID=on 

It creates an executable lmp in the directory. You can add as many packages as you want and you can create different build if you need it.


Run LAMMPS
----------

Create a bash file named *sub.sh* with the following content:

.. code-block:: bash

    #!/bin/bash
    #OAR -n test
    #OAR -l /nodes=1/cpu=1/core=4,walltime=12:00:00
    #OAR --stdout log.out
    #OAR --stderr log.err
    #OAR --project tamtam

    # Path to the LAMMPS executable
    lmp=/path/lmp_mpi

    mpirun -np 4 ${lmp} -in input.lmp

where ``input.lmp`` is your LAMMPS input file, and where the project was assumed
to be `tamtam` (to adapt to your case). Here, 4 CPU cores are requested,
as well as a total duration of 12 hours. Then, make the file file executable with
chmod and launch it using:

.. code-block:: bash

    chmod +x ./sub.sh
    oarsub -S ./sub.sh

Launch multiple jobs using bash
_______________________________

Assuming that one has the job submission script named *sub.sh* with name *lmp-myvariable-0*,
that launch a lammps input script named *input.lmp* by passing a variable
named *myvariable* into it. Additionally, here the job ID is used as an
input for the random seed, allowing for example different initial configurations:

.. code:: bash

    #!/bin/bash
    #OAR -n lmp-myvariable-0
    #OAR -l /nodes=1/cpu=1/core=4,walltime=12:00:00
    #OAR --stdout log.out
    #OAR --stderr log.err
    #OAR --project tamtam

    # Path to the LAMMPS executable
    lmp=/path/lmp_mpi

    myvariable=0

    # Run LAMMPS using MPI, with 4 processes, using the input from 'input.lmp'
    mpirun -np 4 ${lmp} -in input.lmp -var nb2 ${myvariable} -var seedin $OAR_JOBID

If one wants to launch the current job, one simply have to type:

.. code:: bash

    chmod +x sub.sh
    oarsub -S ./sub.sh

and a single job with name *lmp-myvariable-0* will be send.
To launch multiple simulations with different values of *myvariable*,
say 0, 1, and 2, one can create a second bash script, named *multi-sub.sh*,
and containing:

.. code:: bash

    #!/bin/bash
    set -e

    for myvariable in 0 1 2
    do
        # deal with OAR -n
        newline='#OAR -n lmp-myvariable-'$myvariable
        oldline=$(cat sub.sh | grep '#OAR -n lmp-myvariable-')
        sed -i '/'"$oldline"'/c\'"$newline" sub.sh
        # deal with myvariable
        newline='myvariable='$myvariable
        oldline=$(cat sub.sh | grep 'myvariable =')
        sed -i '/'"$oldline"'/c\'"$newline" sub.sh
        chmod +x sub.sh
        oarsub -S ./sub.sh
    done

The *newline* command creates a new line that will replace the line
containing *myvariable* in the script sub.sh
The *oldline=* command finds the current line in sub.sh that contains 'myvariable =',
storing it in the variable oldline. This assumes there is exactly one such line,
otherwise the behavior may be unexpected. Then, sed is used to replace the old
line with the new line (newline) in *sub.sh*.

Then, simply run *multi-sub.sh* by typing:

.. code:: bash

    bash multi-sub.sh
